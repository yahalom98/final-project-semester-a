# final-project-semester-a

As we near the end of the semester, it's time to put your knowledge and skills in action to build a real-life product. The guidelines for this project are intentionally loose to allow you a lot of flexibility to build something interesting and useful:

- Must have some server-side functionality written in Firebase
- Must have a clear data model
- Must support [create, read, update, and delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations
- Must be a *new* application (cannot be something you wrote prior to this class)

That's about it for requirements, but chances are your app will require more features. You _may_ want to optionally include the following:

- Persistent storage (using a database)
- Search/querying
- User authentication
- Client-side UI frameworks (React)
- API
- Responsive Web Design (Bootstrap)


The due date for the final project is midnight, March 10. Please prioritize so that your application contains all of the critical features by that time, and work on the optional functionality after the core ones are completed.

## Here are some ideas you can work on:

Project Idea 1: Task Management Application
Overview:
Develop a task management application using React, Firebase, and either Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Users should be able to sign up, log in, add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. Firebase Authentication will be used for user management, and Firebase Firestore will store task data.

Requirements:

- Authentication:
Users should be able to sign up and log in securely.
Implement Firebase Authentication for user management.
Task Management:

- Users should be able to add, edit, mark tasks as complete, and delete them.
Use Firebase Firestore to store task data and implement CRUD operations.
User Interface:

- Design a clean and intuitive user interface for task management.
Utilize Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.
Routing:

- Implement navigation between different pages (e.g., login, dashboard, task management) using React Router.
Error Handling:

Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Documentation:

- Provide clear documentation on how to use the application and any setup instructions.
  
Project Idea 2: Recipe Sharing Platform
- Overview:
Create a recipe sharing platform where users can share their favorite recipes. Users should be able to create, edit, and delete recipes. Firebase Authentication will be used for user management, and Firebase Firestore will store recipe data.

Requirements:

- Authentication:
Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication.
Recipe Management:

- Users should be able to create, edit, and delete recipes.
Use Firebase Firestore to store recipe data and implement CRUD operations.

Error Handling:
- Provide comprehensive documentation on how to use the platform and any setup instructions.
  
Project Idea 3: E-commerce Website
Overview:
Develop a simple e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Firebase Firestore will store product information, and Firebase Authentication will handle user management.

Requirements:

- Authentication:

- Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication.
Product Management:

- Create a database to store product information using Firebase Firestore.
Allow users to browse products, view details, and add them to the cart.
